## Write a program to implement bubble sort

The bubble sort uses a straightforward logic that works by repeating swapping the adjacent elements if they are not in the right order. It compares one pair at a time and swaps if the first element is greater than the second element; otherwise, move further to the next pair of elements for comparison.

## Example:

```
We are creating a list of element, which stores the integer numbers
list1 = [5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2]
Here the algorithm sort the elements -
First iteration
[5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2]
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: s1 = "attack", s2 = "defend"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to make them equal with one string swap.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: s1 = "kelb", s2 = "kelb"
Output: true
Explanation: The two strings are already equal, so no string swap operation is required.
```
